    <h2 style="color:#fbd75c;">Why astronomy is theoretically fascinating:</h2> 
    <ul style="color:#fbd75c; font-family:Verdana">
      <li>It can lead to humanity discovering if life can be sustained independent of earth.</li>
      <br>
      <li>It can lead to discovery of useful materials on other planets</li>
      <br>
      <li>The pursuit of astronomical knowledge usually leads to the discovery technology that is useful in other fields. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color:#fbd75c;">Examples of how it's pragmatic:</h2> 
    <ul style="color:#fbd75c; font-family:Verdana">
      <li>A method developed by radio astronomers is now used as a non-invasive way to detect tumours.</li>
      <br>
      <li>X-ray observatory technology is also used in current X-ray luggage belts in airports.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Observations of stellar distributions on the sky ,which are used to point and calibrate telescopes, are also used in aerospace engineering.</li>
